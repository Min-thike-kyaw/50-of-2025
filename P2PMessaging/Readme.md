# WebRTC Mesh Video Chat

A simple multi-peer video conferencing app built using **WebRTC** and **WebSocket** for signaling.

- ✅ Supports multiple participants using a mesh topology
- ✅ Live audio/video streaming between peers
- ✅ Uses lightweight dependencies: `express` and `ws`
- ✅ Simple Node.js signaling server

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
node server.js

## 📝 Future Features (if I revisit)
These are possible extensions to the app if I decide to work on it again:

- Add room-based system for better scalability  
- End-to-end encryption for messages  
- Chat UI between peers
